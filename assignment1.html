		Assignment 1: "The Shy Robot" by Alex Sugurel
		<br>
		Class DGMD E-12 Spring 2018
		<br><br>
		The inspiration image of the ‘Dancers’ plays with the artistic expressivity in body language, performance and mystery of theater stage. In ‘Shy Robot’, as the light turns on we discover that there is much more to the image, not only in terms of the humanoid figure, but also the background.This is a good example that things are not always what they seem, as Cervantes would put it in his novel about Don Quixote: “Thou hast seen nothing yet.” 
		<br> <br>
		As opposed to the the daring postures of the ‘Dancers’, the shy robot has a modest and reserved body language. 
		Furthermore, as the eyes follow the mouse, he establishes a closer relationship with the viewer, generating empathy and a bond. 
		The shy robot becomes the observer, and the bviewer becomes the performer that plays with the elements of the stage.
		<br> <br>
		As the viewer has full control over the light, he is not only bonding with the character, but now is an active participant in altering his state and environment. 
		Will the viewer respect the privacy of the robot and keep the environment dark, or will curiosity push towards exploration?
